# Drum Machine
Author: Emily Quinn Finney
Version: 1.0

In this package I implemented built an electronic drum machine that prints 
drum rhythms across the CLI. The package is written in Python, tested in pytest,
and uses various data types including generators and bitmaps. 

I intend to add more features to this drum machine, including the ability to 
play sound, as time permits.
